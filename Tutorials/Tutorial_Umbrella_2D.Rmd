This tutorial explains how to run Umbrella when multi-channel data are available in an RData file in the correct format.

To create an RData file from .csv files, please consult `Tutorial_DataCreation`.

To analyse single-channel data, please consult `Tutorial_Umbrella_2D`.


# Introduction to R

First, load the RData file ```Tutorial_2D.RData```.
You can do this through File -> Load Workspace in Base R,
or File -> Open File... in RStudio.
Alternatively, execute the following command after changing the path accordingly

```{r loading data}
load("C:\\temp\\Tutorial_2D.RData")
```

With the `ls()` command, you can see all objects currently loaded.  
In RStudio, such list can also be consulted in the Global Environment,
in the upper right panel.

```{r overview}
ls()
```
This file contains three objects:

* "Tutorial.Plate.2D", a simulated example dataset
* "Umbrella2d", the Umbrella function for multichannel data
* "PlotUmbrella2d", a routine to create graphics

You can check the structure of an R object with `str()` and `attributes()`

```{r data structure}
str(Tutorial.Plate.2D)
```

Input data for Umbrella needs to be structured as a list with a single, named entry for each partition set.

Let's make scatterplots of the data:
```{r scatterplots of data, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6){
plot(Tutorial.Plate.2D[[i]],pch=20,xlab="fluorescence intensity Channel 1",
     ylab="fluorescence intensity Channel 2",main=paste("scatterplot of",names(Tutorial.Plate.2D)[i]))
}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

We see that the clusters are nicely separated in Target 1, while Target2 and Target3 show increasing rain.


# Running Umbrella

In general, you want to open the ```Umbrella_2D.R``` file and run all the code in it.  Note that this file will have a version number which can change as the software gets updated: e.g. ```Umbrella_2d_V0.R```

For this tutorial, the functions have already been included in the Rdata file.

Umbrella requires 5 other packages to be loaded, these are:
MASS, mgcv, robust, modeest, OrdMonReg

Please intall them before running the procedure.
This can be done through Packages -> Install Package(s)... in Base R
or with Tools -> Install Packages... in RStudio.
In most installations, running the following code will work as well:
```
install.packages(c("MASS","mgcv","robust","modeest","OrdMonReg"))
```

Run Umbrella on the tutorial data set with the following code:


```{r load packages,include=FALSE}
library("MASS")
library("mgcv")
library("robust")
library("modeest")
library("OrdMonReg")
```
```{r Run Umbrella}
ResTut <- Umbrella2d(Tutorial.Plate.2D,NTC=c("NTC1","NTC2","NTC3"))
```
Only the first argument is needed.  This should be a list of partition sets with each having two channel fluorescence intensities.

Currently, there are four optional arguments:

* vol= for the volume in nanoliter, default value 0.85 for Bio-Rad's QX100.
* NTC= for a vector with names of the NTCs.  
* Plate= find cluster center using information from all partitions sets or not.   If true, all plate information may be used to calculate cluster centres (default).  If false, only cluster information (if given) and individual partition sets are used.
* Rotate= how to correct for rotation/tilt of the clusters.
If false, no data rotation is performed. (default).  If true, data gets rotated based on a default, partition set-based algorithm.  If "Plate", data gets rotated based on data from complete plate.	If a name of one or multiple partition sets is given, all partition sets are rotated based on data from this (these) reference(s).

In this example, we keep the default value for the volume, plate and rotate, while supplying three NTCs with names NTC1, NTC2, NTC3.  
Note: Umbrella can run without NTCs, but underlying distributional assumptions are likely violated in this case!  Please do provide NTCs.

Extensive output is stored in the "ResTut" object.
The name of the result object can be freely chosen.

While the procedure is running, some output is already shown in the R console.  This includes:

* During the first run: messages about all packages that are loaded.
* The steps when they are concluded.
* Per partition set:

 + The time to complete the estimation step.
 + The number of partitions (for each channel).
 + The number of positives and the concentration for both the overall Umbrella estimator and a probabilistic threshold estimator (for each channel).
 + A confidence interval for this number and the concentration (for each channel).

A new object, in this case named "ResTut" is created.  
The structure of this object can be summarized with `str()`.
The object is a list with a separate entry for each partition set.
The structure is the same over all partition sets.
In what follows, we'll look at the details for Target3.

```{r structure of an Umbrella object}
str(ResTut$Target3,max.level=1)
```

For each partition set, a list of 11 pieces of information is created.  In what follows, we'll go through all of them, although most likely you will only want to use the first few.

01. $ conc

```{r output$conc}
ResTut$Target3$conc$x
ResTut$Target3$conc$y
```

For each of the channels separately:
These are the estimates of (i) the probability to be positive and (ii) the concentration of the sample (in copies/microliter) for both Umbrella estimators (overall and probability threshold). (first line)
Additionally, their standard deviation (second line) and confidence intervals are added (third and fourth line).  
Note: proper standard deviations and confidence intervals can only be calculated when multiple NTCs are provided

02. $ thres

```{r output$thres}
ResTut$Target3$tresh$x
ResTut$Target3$tresh$y
```

For each of the channels separately:
These are the proportion (probability) of partitions that are positive (pos), negative (neg) or rain (rain) with a confidence interval on each, as well as the associated absolute numbers.  
Proportions are calculated as absolute numbers divided by the total number of partitions.

03. $ fits

```{r output$fits}
ResTut$Target3$fits
```

Estimates used for the mode (mu),  robust deviation (sig)
and the probability that a random target partition is negative (pi) for both channels.
These estimates are recalculated for each combination with a different NTC.  I.e.: the first number refers to the estimate calculated and used in the joint model with Target3 and NTC1, the second number is the estimate from the model with Target3 and NTC2, and so on.
Additionally, the ratio of the variation in the single positive clusters compared to the double negative cluster.

04. $ data

```{r output$data, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
plot(ResTut$Target3$data)
```

The original data with a clustering (preprocessed clustering, not final!) added.

05. $ droppi

```{r output$droppi, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
plot(ResTut$Target3$droppi)
```

For each of the channels separately:
The estimates for the individual partition probabilities

06. $ dropci

```{r}
str(ResTut$Target3$dropci)
```

For each of the channels separately:
Confidence intervals for the individual droplet probabilities

07. $ reppi

```{r output$reppi}
str(ResTut$Target3$reppi)
```

For each of the channels separately:
The original partition probabilities per NTC before antitonic regression and averaging over NTCs.  Mainly used for quality control (QC).

08. $ densfits

```{r output$densfits}
str(ResTut$Target3$densfits)
```

For each of the channels separately:
The fitted density of the target when jointly modelled with each NTC.

09. $ ntcfits

```{r output$ntcfits}
str(ResTut$Target3$ntcfits)
```

For each of the channels separately:
The fitted density of each NTC when jointly modelled with the target.

10. $ pifits

```{r output$pifits}
str(ResTut$Target3$pifits)
```

For each of the channels separately:
Ratio between target and NTC around the mode.
Can be used for QC.


11. $ cluspi

```{r output$cluspi}
str(ResTut$Target3$cluspi)
```

The estimates for the individual partition probabilities per cluster rather than per channel: i.e.: the probability to be double negative, single negative on channel 1, single negative on channel 2, double positive.

12. $ name

Name of the partition set, mainly used for internal automatic calling and matching and when displaying the results.


# Summarizing Output 

### Automatic Figures
We created a file to provide some useful figures automatically.
To use this, you generally want to open ```Graphics_Umbrella_2d.R``` and execute all the code.  For this tutorial, we included the function in the already loaded RData file.

Change the path below to the folder where you want figures to appear and then run the code.

```{r set directory,eval=F}
setwd("C:/temp")
```

Run the code below to generate and save some graphics directly onto your hard disk.

```{r Run PlotUmbrella}
PlotUmbrella2d(ResTut,"Tutorial2D")
```

The command has three arguments of which two are required.

 * The name of an object created by the Umbrella2d procedure (here: ResTut)
 * A name for the files that can be freely chosen (here: Tutorial2D)  
 * Optionally, the resolution can be chosen with the `res=` command (default 120 dpi)

For each partition set, two summary plots will be created.  The first one consists of two figures similar to the middle panel of Figure 2 of our manuscript, one for each channel (univariate summary).  The second shows the scatterplot of the data three times, once as the original data, and twice after rotation and coloured with probabilities per channel.  Important numeric output is added to this plot as well.  Finally, a single QC figure is added (all partition sets together).

As an example, for Target3, Figure 1 shows the univariate output, while Figure 2 shows the multivariate graphs.

![Univariate output of PlotUmbrella2d](Tutorial2D_Target3_full_results_1D.png)

![Multivariate output of PlotUmbrella2d](Tutorial2D_Target3_full_results_2D.png)

Using the R object (ResTut here), it is possible to create custom output.
We give a few handy examples similar to figures in the manuscript.

### Table with concentration estimates

Creating a table with concentration estimates for the complete plate / experiment can be done with the following code:

```{r Main Umbrella concentration estimates}
conrobx <- t(sapply(ResTut,function(PS){PS$conc$x[c(1,3,4),2]}))
conrobx
```
The table above displays the results of the main Umbrella estimator for the first channel.


```{r Threshold Umbrella concentration estimates}
conptrx <- t(sapply(ResTut,function(PS){PS$conc$x[c(1,3,4),4]}))
conptrx
```
This table shows the results of the probability threshold estimator for the first channel.

Results for the second channel can be obtained by replacing x by y or joining both.

We can now save these together in a handy comma separated value file,
which can be opened by most data processing programs, but also in Excel, Notepad, etc.
```{r Save concentration estimates,eval=F}
concdat <- rbind(t(sapply(ResTut,function(PS){PS$conc$x[c(1,3,4),c(2,4)]})),
                 t(sapply(ResTut,function(PS){PS$conc$y[c(1,3,4),c(2,4)]})))
colnames(concdat) <- c("est_main","CI_LB_main","CI_UB_main","est_thres","CI_LB_thres","CI_UB_thres")
write.csv(data.frame(PartSet=rownames(concdat),Channel=rep(c("Ch1","Ch2"),each=6),concdat),
          file="Tutorial_Concentrations.csv",row.names=F)
```


### Plotting the concentrations
This creates output similar to Figure 3 in the manuscript, now with two channels plotted next to each other rather than two different methods.

```{r Concentrations plotted, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
conroby <- t(sapply(ResTut,function(PS){PS$conc$y[c(1,3,4),2]}))
ymaxs <- max(conrobx[conrobx<Inf],conroby[conroby<Inf])
npset <- nrow(conrobx)
par(mar=c(1,4,1,1))
plot(NULL,ylim=c(0,ymaxs),xlim=c(0,npset+1),
	main="",xlab="",xaxt="n",
	ylab=expression(paste("concentration (cp/",mu,"l)",sep="")))
for(i in 1:npset){
lines(c(i-0.1,i-0.1),c(conrobx[i,2],conrobx[i,3]))
lines(c(i+0.1,i+0.1),c(conroby[i,2],conroby[i,3]))
points(i-0.1,conrobx[i,1],col="blue",pch=16)
points(i+0.1,conroby[i,1],col="green",pch=16)
}
```
